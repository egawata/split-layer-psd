- `-f`: (*required*) psd filename
- `-o`: directory to save images. If omitted, the same directory with psd file is used.
- `-bgcolor=(color value)`: fill background with specified color.
    - color name: one of `black` `blue` `red` `magenta` `green` `cyan` `yellow` and `white`
    - hex color code: like `f3c791`
- `-bw`: fill background with white. shorthand for `-bgcolor=white`
- `-keep-original-bound`: apply bound of original psd to each layer images.
    - By default, transparent rectangle areas near borders are trimmed. This option avoids the trimming.
